## Quarfs!, a new generation using rust

basically, yet another voxel engine.
Do not expect fancy techniques, I am happy with having some cubes on screen.

# TODO:
- [x] single file shader pipeline. 
    - [ ] improve error reporting
    - [ ] add common text (uniforms and shading version)
- [x] tessellated terrain. 
    - [ ] fix issue with the two triangles, one up, one down. (is there a way to identify triangles from the same primitive quad?)
